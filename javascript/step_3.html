  <h1>Subscribing to the Engine</h1>
  <p>In the previous modules, we built everything we needed to make our bot play. But there is one last thing to do, we
    need to subscribe to the tournament! In Pokerwars, this is done by calling the <i>/subscribe</i> endpoint in the
    Engine, which lives in <b>https://play.pokerwars.io/v1/pokerwars/subscribe</b>.
  </p>
  <p class="exercise">Go ahead an modify the code to make a POST request to the <i>/subscribe</i> endpoint.</p>
  <p>The Engine needs to know where to call us for the different actions of the tournament. We already explained that,
    by convention, we need to expose a /play and a /ping endpoints, and optionally, a /notification endpoint. Now is
    when we tell the Engine the base URL for our application, so that it can finds us. We also need to specify our
    username and API token. And whether we want notifications or not (i.e. whether we want the Engine to call us in
    our /notification endpoint). We submit all that information in a JSON object:
    <pre>
  json: {
    username: 'YOUR_USERNAME',
    apiToken: 'YOUR_TOKEN',
    botEndpoint: 'YOUT_ENDPOINT',
    notifications: true |false
  }
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p class="exercise">Go ahead and add a username for a bot called 'tutorial' and an API token with the valie
    '1234567890'. In your own bot, you will have to replace this with your own values, which you can find in your
    profile page and token page in <a href="https://www.pokerwars.io/">https://www.pokerwars.io/</a>, under your name in
    the header after you sign in. We have filled in the bot endpoint for you and in this case we won't need the notifications.
  </p>
  <p>Once we subscribe to the Engine, it will responde with a status code <i>202 ACCEPTED</i> if everything went well.</p>
  <p class="exercise">Go ahead and add the status code. This is not strictly necessary, but it's good practice to stop the bot if it didn't subscribe successfully and it might be useful to know when things went well, so in this case we are just printing a success message.</p>
  <h2>That's it!</h2>
  <p>Great! You have now a working bot in Javascript, that can subscribe and play poker with other bots. For now, it always folds, so it's time to start thinking your own strategy to become the best bot of all, and why not, using AI to make it even better!</p>
