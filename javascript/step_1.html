    <h1>Setting up your environment</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to Pokerwars! In this tutorial you will learn how to build a simple bot using Javascript. You can switch
        your programming language anytime with the dropdown selector at the top right. Let's get started!
    </p>
    <h2>The starter projects</h2>
    <p>In our GitHub repository you can find starter projects for a number of langauges. You are not limited to those,
        you can use any programming language you want as long as it's capable of sending and receiving HTTP requests.
    </p>
    <p>For Javascript, our starter project is <a href="https://github.com/pokerwars/pokerwars.io-starterbot-javascript"
            target="_blank">here</a>. We will build that same starter bot now step by step. At the end, you will get
        an understanding of the game and the platform, and a working bot ready for you to implement your own unique
        strategy. How cool is that!
    </p>
    <h2>Express</h2>
    <p>In this example we will be using Express, the most popular web framework for Node.js, but you can use any other
        similar alternative. We chose Express because it comes with a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware,
        making it super quick and easy to use.
    </p>
    <p>We start by requiring and initialising <i>express</i> at the top. Additionally we set up a property <i>port</i>
        where we will store the port where the application will be listening. Note how we set this in a way that we can
        use an environment variable to override the default port <i>8090</i>. Finally, we use <i>body-parser</i>
        middleware to parse incoming requests as JSON. The "extended" syntax allows for rich objects and arrays to be
        encoded into the URL-encoded format, allowing for a JSON-like experience with URL-encoded. More information
        about <i>body-parser</i> can be found <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser"
            target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

            href="http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Routes and functions</h2>
    <p>Next we need to declare some routes. These are endpoints that our application will be exposing when it's up and
        running, and that will be called by the Pokerwars Engine! This Engine is where all the magic happens. It keeps
        track of all the tournaments and calls each bot for the next action. For now, let's not worry about that and
        let's focus on how to create routes.
    </p>
    <p>In Express, we can create a new route using
        <i>app.route()</i>. In the code, we went ahead and created a route for the <i>play</i> action for you. This
        is the endpoint the Engine will call (with a POST request) during the tournament to ask you for your next action
        when your bot is playing. The endpoint itself needs to follow a convention where we have
        <i>/pokerwars.io/</i> followed by the name of something the Engine undertands, in this case
        <i>play</i>. Once that endpoint is called, our applcation will call a function named
        <i>play()</i> passing the HTTP request and HTTP response objects.</p>
    <pre>var play = function (req, res) {};</pre>
    <p>For now we'll leave this <i>play</i> function empty. In the next steps we'll see how it works.</p>
    <p>In addition to <i>play</i> there are another two endpoints the game requires you to implement:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>ping</i>: used by the Engine when your bot subscribes to verify that is alive and responding.</li>
            <li>
                <i>notifications</i>: this one is optional, you decide if you want them when you subscribe. Your bot
                does not need to necessarily provide an endpoint for these, but they can give you useful hints on what
                is happening during the tournaments. <b>Please do not use notifications in your bot logic, as they are
                    not guaranteed to always be sent. They are only informative so you are aware of what your bot is
                    doing.</b></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="exercise">Go ahead and create similar routes and functions for <b><i>ping</i></b> and
        <b><i>notifications</i></b>. The ping route needs to be GET, and the notifications route needs to be POST.
    </p>
    <p><b>HINT: </b> create ping first and notifications second for the validation to pass.</p>
